# Encryptionged√∂ns

Some personal testing around AES-CTR for another project, seeing how to implement functionality allowing for encryption/decryption of an arbitrary block instead of a stream as the standard library allows. Proved simple enough (assuming I did it correctly), but a ready-made library with the same functionality would be preferred.
